# TuniHack

# Building The Dataset
 In this phase, we attempt to build a dictionary for the tunisian sign language and gather datasets for our models.
  ## Context
   As a first step, we have decided to limit ourselves to the context of a medical consultation. We've worked with a general practitioner that described the medical consultation. And using that description, we've extracted a list of words that we will use for our dictionary. 
   ## Building from Scratch
   We were able to find <strong>"Medical Dictionary in Tunisian Sign Languages"</strong> a dictionnary created by the IFT making the translation from french to Tunisian Sign Language
   ## Already Available Ressources
   As described this booklet contains 160 words used in the context of a medical consultation with their respective signs. By asking a doctor, we've sampled 16 relevant words as a starting size for our vocabulary.


## Video shooting guidlines
These are the rules we imposed when we shot the videos:
- FPS (frames per second): 30
- Min/Max quality: 720p
- Framing: follow "Medical Dictionary in Tunisian Sign Languages" picture framing
- Sign speed: calibrate to one of the interpreters' signing speed
- Orientation: vertical
